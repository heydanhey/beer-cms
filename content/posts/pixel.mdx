A simple [site](https://pixel.heydanhey.com/) to create your own pixel art!
Well, A project I started and never finished ðŸ˜….

I made this to be the first consumer of my [design system](https://heydanhey.github.io/design-system).
I know, I know a design system? Well, not really. But I wanted to start building some components
and pacakges in a monorepo structure. It also uses github actions to release, publish and deploy to
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40heydan).
